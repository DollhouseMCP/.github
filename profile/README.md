# DollhouseMCP Organization

## Build Your AI Tools with Natural Language

DollhouseMCP lets you create **Personas**, **Skills**, **Templates**, **Agents**, and **Memory** elements to customize your AI experience. Build once, use everywhere; your elements work across platforms and follow you wherever you work. Whether you're automating a series of professional emails, getting advice from Mr. Rogers, summarizing long conversations, running a D&D campaign with the complete rulebook on call, or automating code reviews, our open source Model Context Protocol server gives you the tools to work exactly how you want.

### üéØ Our Mission

Enable everyone to customize their AI experience using natural language. Provide tools that persist across sessions and platforms, that can be shared with the community, and gather community insight to elevate artificial intelligence.

## üé≠ What is DollhouseMCP?

**For Everyone**: Run a Murder Mystery dinner party with AI that knows all the clues. Organize your home with a persona that knows how you like things and memories that know where you put things. Don't just let AI tell you what's professional or casual writing, show it examples of your work. It can learn how to write in your voice and will remember your turns of phrase to help clarify your writing while keeping it authentically you.

**For Developers**: Build elements for any workflow. Security Analyst personas, Penetration Testing skills, Data Analysis capabilities, or train AI to write in your voice‚Äîall work across any MCP-compatible system.

**For Businesses**: Free up your team for work that requires human creativity and judgment. Build elements that automate review against your requirements, organize information for better absorption, and maintain quality standards. Handle the tedious tasks automatically so people can focus on what actually needs their talent, and attention.
